# Forcing Data

## Variables

Information about the forcing variables can be obtained by asking the HICAR executable about a specific forcing variable. This can be done as:

`./HICAR -v pvar`

in the case of the pressure variable, giving the output:

```text
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Namelist Variable:           pvar
     Namelist Group:.........|Forcing
     Description:............|Name of the pressure variable in forcing file
     Units:..................|Pa
     Dimensions:.............|[T, Z, Y, X]
```

A list of all possible forcing variables can be found by generating the default namelist (see [namelist_options.md](namelist_options.md)), then looking under the "forcing" group.

A partial list of the available forcing variables is below, with optional variables in square brackets:

```Text
qvvar         = Water Vapor mixing ratio                  (kg/kg)
tvar          = Air Temperature                           (K with an optional offset)
pvar          = Pressure                                  (Pa)
uvar          = East-West wind                            (m/s)
vvar          = North-South wind                          (m/s)
[wvar]        = Vertical wind                             (m/s)
hgtvar        = Terrain Height                            (m)
zvar          = 3D model level heights                    (m)
latvar        = Latitude on mass (P/T/etc.) grid          (degrees)
lonvar        = Longitude on mass (P/T/etc.) grid         (degrees)
[ulat]        = Latitude on the EW-wind grid              (degrees)
[ulon]        = Longitude on the EW-wind grid             (degrees)
[vlat]        = Latitude on the NS-wind grid              (degrees)
[vlon]        = Longitude on the NS-wind grid             (degrees)
[sst_var]     = Sea Surface Temperature                   (K)
[swdown_var]  = Shortwave down at the surface             (W/m^2)
[lwdown_var]  = Longwave down at the surface              (W/m^2)
[shvar]       = Sensible heat flux from the surface       (W/m^2)
[lhvar]       = Latent heat flux from the surface         (W/m^2)
[pbl_var]     = Specified height of PBL                   (m)
```

## Variable data structure

Forcing variables must conform to a known layout, as follows:

4-D variables (spatial):
[time, Z, Y, X]

3-D variables (spatial):
[Z, Y, X]

2-D variables (spatial):
[Y, X]

Information about the ordering and meaning of a variable's dimensions be obtained by asking the HICAR executable about a specific forcing variable, such as:

`./HICAR -v pvar`

in the case of the pressure variable.

## netCDF data type

Please ensure that the netCDF library which HICAR was compiled with supports parallel I/O for the netCDF file type which you are using. Parallel netCDF built on HDF5 only supports the netCDF-4 data type, while PnetCDF can only read classic netCDF data types.
